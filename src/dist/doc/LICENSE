Licensing Overview

The original version of some pieces of this application were covered by
the Apache Software License (Version 2.0) as described below.

Revisions to this code (application and libraries) as made by the RPTools.net team
are licensed differently, using the GPL v3 for the application and LGPL v3 for libraries.
These licenses are "upward compatible" (since the Apache license has no restrictions
and the GPL/LGPL only adds compatible requirements).  This license simply states that
if someone distributes binaries created from this source code, they must make the
source code itself (with their modifications) available.  See the detailed text, below.

The Apache license requires credit where credit is due, so each library has a "readme"
file that is part of the source distribution (and is included in the deployment packages)
specifying the details for the relevant library.

The RPTools team originally felt that the "forced redistribution of source code" was too
onerous, but in this day of ubiquitous high speed Internet connections, free web site
hosting, and free source code repositories for open source projects, this hardly seems
the case any more.  Thus, with the blessing of the original RPTools team the license
going forward will be GPL v3 for all application code and LGPL v3 for all libraries.

Included herein are summaries of each license; see the specified URLs and aforementioned
readme files for details.
